/* The main process is the server process.  It enters render_server_main and
 * never returns except on fatal errors.
 *
 * The server process supports only one connection currently.  It creates a
 * render_client to manage the connection.  There is a client process at the
 * other end of the connection.  When the client process requests a new
 * context to be created, the server process creates a worker.  It also sets
 * up a socket pair, with one end owned by the worker and the other end sent
 * to and owned by the client process.
 *
 * When a worker is a thread, the thread enters render_context_main directly
 * from its start function.  In this case, render_context_main must be
 * thread-safe.
 *
 * When a worker is a process,
 * - On Linux, it's a subprocess forked from the server process. It returns
 *   from render_server_main and enters render_context_main.
